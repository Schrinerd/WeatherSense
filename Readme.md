# WeatherSense
This is a hobby project to play with inside and outside temperatures and a Raspberry Pi.


Inside temperatures are logged from a temperature sensor connected to the GPIO pins.
Outside temperatures are retrieved from OpenWeatherMap.org's API.
Temperatures are then graphed with Matplotlib and saved as an image.


The image is viewed using the RPi as a local webserver.
