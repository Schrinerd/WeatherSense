# WeatherSense
This is a hobby project to play with inside and outside temperatures.
Inside temperatures are logged from a temperature sensor on the GPIO pins.
Outside temperatures are scraped from OpenWeatherMap.org.
Temperatures are then graphed with Matplotlib, and saved as an image to view on a local webserver.
